# MLSAKIET_GENAI_INTERNSHIP_PROJECTS

During this **MLSA KIET Internship**, I have gained valuable hands-on experience in the field of **Generative AI**,
by making real time projects and gaining knowledge about this field. I have made 2 projects under this 
internship i.e. **A BASIC TEXT GENERATOR** and **A SENTIMNET ANALYISIS TOOL**. Both these tools are made with 
the help of pre-trained engine such as **GPT-2** and the **TRANSFORMERS** library of **HuggingFace**.Overall this 
experienced has help me in deepening my knowledge in this domain.

## PROJECT DETAILS

## BASIC TEXT GENERATOR
It is a tool which takes user prompt and generates Human-like readable text based on the input.

### DETAILS 

1. It uses a pre-trained language model like **GPT-2**.
2. It uses the **Transformers** library to lad the pre-trained model and the **torch** library.
3. The API used is the **Hugging Face Transformer API**. 
4. The tool converts the input into tokens which are further converted into ID's for easy processing and pass it through 
various **NLP LAYERS** to produce the next token.
5.  The generated token is then appended to the input prompt by converting into human-readable text.

### LIBRARIES USED

1. **TRANSFORMERS (GPT2Tokenizer,GPT2LMHeadModel)**
2. **torch (PyTorch)**

### APPLICATIONS
1. It is generally used in writing E-mails.
2. Writing content for a post.


## SENTIMENT ANALYSIS TOOL
It is tool which is takes the text as input from the user and then predicts the sentiment of the text i.e. it is either 
positive, negative or neutral. It determines the sentiment based on the probability from 0 to 1.

### DETAILS

1. This tool is built using the AI Builder of the Power Automate which has already a pre-trained Sentiment Analysis model.
2. It cleans the text and later standardize it for analysis.
3. The result generated is then stored in a database such as Excel Sheet for future use.
4. It automates the Sentiment Tracking and saves time.

### REQUIRENMENT

1. **Microsoft Power Platform Access**
2. **Requires Text Data for analysis.**
3. **Power Automate Flow**
4. **Database**

### APPLICATIONS
1. It is used in marketing fields and analysing feebacks.

## CONCLUSION
The future of Generative AI holds immense potential across various industries. Also there is a significant 
advancement in the field of machine learnning and network language processing.It helps in personalizing user 
experience and helps in decision making. As I continue my learning in this field , I am eager to explore the 
the various possibilities and contribute to the development of this field.
